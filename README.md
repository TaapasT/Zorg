# Zorg
This is the project ReadMe file. 

Zorg is the first-ever application to fasten up your visit to the doctor. It can stor your medical history, generate bills or generate your medical certificate in clicks and storing it on your device without losing your papers and time filing everything up. Every record can be accessed easily with even a login system. This prototype enables you to give a brief outline of the concept and the idea. 

Every contribution will be credited. This is an open-source project.

This prototype belongs to Taapas Trivedi.
